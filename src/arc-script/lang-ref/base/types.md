# Types

A **type** is a syntactic construct which represents a set of **values** with common behavior. All expressions in Arc-Script have a statically inferred type which indicates what set of values they evaluate into. Items types such as functions need to be annotated with types in their signature, but can be generic.

<pre>
<code>Type ::=
  | Scalar                    # Scalar-type
  | <'{'> <'('> Name <':'> Type <','>)+ <'}'>     # Record-type
  | <'('> (Type <','>)+ <')'>             # Tuple-type
  | <'fun'> <'('> (Type <','>)+ <')'> <':'> Type  # Function-type
  | Type? <'..'> (<'='>? Type)?       # Range-type
  | Path (<'['> (Type <','>)* <']'>)?     # Item-type (with optional type parameters)
</code>
</pre>

## Examples

Some examples of different types:

```text
{x:i32, y:str}  # Record-type
(i32, str)      # Tuple-type
fun(x:i32): i32 # Lambda-type
i32..i32        # Exclusive Range-type
i32..=i32       # Inclusive Range-type
```
