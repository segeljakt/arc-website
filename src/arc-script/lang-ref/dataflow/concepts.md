# Dataflow Concepts

Arc-Script's dataflows are *push-based*, meaning that data is pushed from sources to sinks, as opposed to pulled to sinks from sources. Dataflow concepts are oriented around **tasks** that react to events produced by **futures** and **streams** of data and produce new events. These concepts are explained in the coming sections.
